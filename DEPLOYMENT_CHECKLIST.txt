## 🔥 SHOW DEUTSCHE BANK YOU'RE SERIOUS

**In your email/LinkedIn to Moebert:**

"I've set up a landing page at revaluatr.com showcasing our research approach. 
While the full platform is in development, you can see our positioning and 
institutional focus. We're already collecting interest from market participants."

**Why this works:**
✅ Shows you're not just theorizing
✅ Demonstrates professional execution
✅ Proves you have market interest
✅ Makes you look established/credible

## ⚡ ALTERNATE: SUPER FAST DEPLOYMENT (VERCEL)

If you want it live in 60 seconds:

```bash
# 1. Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# 2. Deploy
cd /mnt/user-data/outputs/revaluatr-landing/
vercel deploy --prod

# 3. Connect domain
vercel domains add revaluatr.com
```

**Note:** You'll need to convert `server.py` to serverless function.
See: https://vercel.com/docs/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/python

Or just deploy the static `index.html` and handle form submissions later.
